# terminal-notifier

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/julienXX/terminal-notifier.svg)](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases)

terminal-notifier is a command-line tool to send macOS User Notifications,
which are available on macOS 10.14 and higher as of the current release.


## News

[alerter](https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter) features were merged in terminal-notifier 1.7. This led to some issues and even more issues in the 1.8 release. We decided with [Val√®re Jeantet](https://github.com/vjeantet) to rollback this merge.

From now on terminal-notifier won't have the sticky notification feature nor the actions buttons. If you need them please use [alerter](https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter). I also want to follow [semver](http://semver.org) hence this latest version starts at 2.0.0.

Sticking to two smaller specialized tools will hopefully make them easier to maintain and less error prone.


## Caveats

* It is currently packaged as an application bundle, because `NSUserNotification`
  does not work from a ‚ÄòFoundation tool‚Äô. [radar://11956694](radar://11956694)

* Beginning with 2.x, terminal-notifier uses the modern `UserNotifications` framework. This requires macOS 10.14 or newer and removes the private API overrides that earlier builds relied on.

* If you need to target macOS releases earlier than 10.14, stick to terminal-notifier 2.0.0 or earlier.

* If you're looking for sticky notifications or more actions on a notification please use [alerter](https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter)

## Download

Prebuilt binaries are available from the
[releases section](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases).

Or if you want to use this from
[Ruby](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/tree/master/Ruby), you can
install it through RubyGems:

```
$ [sudo] gem install terminal-notifier
```

You can also install it via [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):
```
$ brew install terminal-notifier
```

## Usage

```
$ ./terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier -[message|group|list] [VALUE|ID|ID] [options]
```

In order to use terminal-notifier, you have to call the binary _inside_ the
application bundle.

The Ruby gem, which wraps this tool, _does_ have a bin wrapper. If installed
you can simply do:

```
$ terminal-notifier -[message|group|list] [VALUE|ID|ID] [options]
```

This will obviously be a bit slower than using the tool without the wrapper.

If you'd like notifications to stay on the screen until dismissed, go to System Preferences -> Notifications -> terminal-notifier and change the style from Banners to Alerts. You cannot do this on a per-notification basis.


### Example Uses

Display piped data with a sound:
```
$ echo 'Piped Message Data!' | terminal-notifier -sound default
```

![Example 1](assets/Example_1.png)

Use a custom icon:
```
$ terminal-notifier -title ProjectX -subtitle "new tag detected" -message "Finished" -appIcon http://vjeantet.fr/images/logo.png
```

![Example 3](assets/Example_3.png)

Open an URL when the notification is clicked:
```
$ terminal-notifier -title 'üí∞' -message 'Check your Apple stock!' -open 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL'
```

![Example 4](assets/Example_4.png)

Open an app when the notification is clicked:
```
$ terminal-notifier -group 'address-book-sync' -title 'Address Book Sync' -subtitle 'Finished' -message 'Imported 42 contacts.' -activate 'com.apple.AddressBook'
```

### Options

At a minimum, you must specify either the `-message` , the `-remove`, or the
`-list` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-message VALUE`  **[required]**

The message body of the notification.

If you pipe data into terminal-notifier, you can omit this option,
and the piped data will become the message body instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-title VALUE`

The title of the notification. This defaults to ‚ÄòTerminal‚Äô.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-subtitle VALUE`

The subtitle of the notification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-sound NAME`

Play the `NAME` sound when the notification appears.
Sound names are listed in `/System/Library/Sounds`.

Use the special `NAME` ‚Äúdefault‚Äù for the default notification sound.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-group ID`

Specifies the notification‚Äôs ‚Äògroup‚Äô. For any ‚Äògroup‚Äô, only _one_
notification will ever be shown, replacing previously posted notifications.

A notification can be explicitly removed with the `-remove` option (see
below).

Example group IDs:

* The sender‚Äôs name (to scope the notifications by tool).
* The sender‚Äôs process ID (to scope the notifications by a unique process).
* The current working directory (to scope notifications by project).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-remove ID`  **[required]**

Remove a previous notification from the `ID` ‚Äògroup‚Äô, if one exists.

Use the special `ID` ‚ÄúALL‚Äù to remove all messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-list ID` **[required]**

Lists details about the specified ‚Äògroup‚Äô `ID`.

Use the special `ID` ‚ÄúALL‚Äù to list details about all currently active messages.

The output of this command is tab-separated, which makes it easy to parse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-activate ID`

Activate the application specified by `ID` when the user clicks the
notification.

You can find the bundle identifier (`CFBundleIdentifier`) of an application in its `Info.plist` file
_inside_ the application bundle.

Examples application IDs are:

* `com.apple.Terminal` to activate Terminal.app
* `com.apple.Safari` to activate Safari.app

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-sender ID`

Requests that the notification appear to come from the application identified by
`ID`. Because macOS now enforces bundle identities at runtime, you must
code-sign the helper with the desired bundle identifier before this flag will be
honoured.

Typical workflow:

1. Duplicate the app bundle: `cp -R terminal-notifier.app MyNotifier.app`
2. Update the bundle identifier: `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIdentifier com.example.sender" MyNotifier.app/Contents/Info.plist`
3. (Optional) Replace `MyNotifier.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns` with the icon you want macOS to display.
4. Codesign it with a certificate that matches that identifier:
   `codesign --force --deep --options runtime --sign "Apple Development: Your Name" MyNotifier.app`

Once the helper is signed, `-sender com.example.sender` will be accepted and the
system will display the icon associated with that signed bundle. Without these
steps the option is ignored and a warning is logged.

Because the notification now launches that application when clicked, `-sender`
still cannot be combined with `-execute` or `-activate`.

For information on the `ID`, see the `-activate` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-appIcon PATH`

Attach an additional image to the notification. macOS no longer allows
terminal-notifier to override its application icon at runtime; instead the image
is delivered as an attachment alongside the notification content. Prefer
`-contentImage` for richer layouts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-contentImage PATH`

Specify an image `PATH` to attach inside of the notification.

**WARNING: This option is subject to change since it relies on a private method.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-open URL`

Open `URL` when the user clicks the notification. This can be a web or file URL,
or any custom URL scheme.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-execute COMMAND`

Run the shell command `COMMAND` when the user clicks the notification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-ignoreDnD`

Ignore Do Not Disturb settings and unconditionally show the notification.

**WARNING: This option is subject to change since it relies on a private method.**
